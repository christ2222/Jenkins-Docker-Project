        Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
        It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying,
        facilitating the integration and delivery of code changes more efficiently. Jenkins has a vast ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality,
        allowing it to integrate with various tools and platforms such as Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and many more.
        Jenkins is widely adopted in the industry due to its flexibility, ease of use, and strong support for a wide range of tools and technologies.
